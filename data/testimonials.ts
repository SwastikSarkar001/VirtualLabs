    testimonial: 'Virtual Labs are implemented in USAR, GGSIPU and are useful in understanding the theories and concepts of science or other subjects that cannot be studied alone only by textbooks. It has the great potential to enhance actual laboratory experiences. Furthermore, the best progressive learning and performance for real experiments appears when the virtual laboratory preceded paper-based practical experiments.'

    testimonial: 'Virtual Labs is the knowledge seed for the students of the science and technology domain. Such an astonishing platform would enlighten the learning path of the students before they move to the real lab for the experiments. The students may realize the look and feel of the real lab and optimize the efforts, time, and funds involved in performing the real labs. The best part of Virtual Labs is to use it with personal comfort and convenience.'

    testimonial: `
      On February 10th, 2023, Dr. Sandhya from C.H. Muhammad Koya Memorial Govt. Arts & Science College in Koduvally, Kozhikode, Kerala attended a Virtual Labs workshop at IIITH with 25 of her students. She was overjoyed to see that despite her initial fears that her students might get bored and hungry, they thoroughly enjoyed every session. The experience was so well-planned that Dr. Sandhya couldnâ€™t help but think that it was something they would cherish forever.
      Most of the students at the college are first-generation learners from their families. Dr. Sandhya wanted them to realize that there is a world beyond their current situation. Their college is in very poor condition; at one point, their computer lab only had four computers, and now they have eight. The college is currently functioning in a temporary building, occupying a portion of another college. Some classrooms are even situated on top of slaughter shops.
      Despite these challenges, some students manage to excel academically. However, many others lose motivation and self-respect when they see their surroundings. They become distracted and are drawn to student politics. Dr. Sandhya hopes that her efforts will inspire at least a few of them to see beyond their immediate environment and pursue their dreams. She wants them to know that there are institutions like IIITH, which can give them a glimpse of what they can achieve if they set their minds to it.

    testimonial: `
      On July 12th 2022, Dr. L Shanmukha Rao, the head of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Kallam Haranadhareddy Institute of Technology in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India, has discovered that Virtual Labs are the optimal choice for Electrical students. In a Virtual Lab, students can experiment with circuits and networks without worrying about power supply issues and can easily analyse the responses through graphics.
      Compared to conducting experiments in the physical environment, Virtual Labs offer a more effective response. Dr. Rao has noted that Virtual Labs are particularly well-suited for the Electrical Circuits Lab and Electrical Machines Lab.Furthermore, the Applied Physics Lab is another area where Virtual Labs have proved to be advantageous. For instance, students can safely experiment with the energy gap of a semiconductor or the Hall effect in a controlled environment.
      Overall, Dr. Rao believes that Virtual Labs are an excellent resource for Electrical students, as they provide a valuable opportunity to learn and experiment without the restrictions and risks of the physical environment.

    testimonial: `
      On March 05th 2022, Mr. B. Lokesh, the Nodal Coordinator for Virtual Labs in Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology (MGIT) College, is excited to share the benefits of the Virtual Lab platform. This platform offers an incredible range of resources and tools, specifically tailored to meet the needs of students in various fields of study. Whether you are studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Civil Engineering, or Information Technology (IT), we have something for you.
      As you might imagine, the world of science and technology is constantly evolving, and it's not always easy to keep up with the latest equipment and technologies. That's where the Virtual Lab comes in. It enables our students to access and experiment with a wide variety of scientific equipment and technologies that are not readily available in our college. For example, CSE and IT students are learning in labs such as Artificial Neural Networks Lab, Computer Architecture & Organization Lab, Computer Organization Lab, Data Structures, Image Processing Lab, Natural Language Processing Lab, and Speech Signal Processing Lab. Meanwhile, Civil Engineering students have been using the Marine Structures Lab to enhance their understanding of theoretical concepts.
      ECE students are benefiting from the Digital Electronic Circuits Lab, while students and teachers of Electrical Engineering are using the platform to access major courses such as Electrical Circuits, Electrical Machines, and Power Systems.
      I strongly encourage all of our students to take advantage of this valuable resource and make use of the Virtual Lab to enhance their knowledge and skills. You can access the Software Engineering Virtual Lab at IIT Kharagpur by visiting http://vlabs.iitkgp.ernet.in/se/. Experience for yourself the incredible range of resources and tools that the Virtual Lab has to offer. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

      In July 2022, Ms. Sarala Davuluru, the Nodal Coordinator for Virtual Labs, shared the innovative use of Virtual Labs in St. Ann's College for Women. I have had the privilege of witnessing the remarkable impact of this technology on our students' learning experience.
      For the last five years, the Department of Physics and Electronics at St. Ann's College has been incorporating virtual simulations into their curriculum. Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the team responsible for developing these labs. The students have found them to be both fascinating and engaging as they explore different parameters and real-time applications. The remarkable synergy between theoretical knowledge and practical application has been well-received.
      What's truly remarkable is that the students' comprehension of the subject and experimental learning has been greatly enhanced. Thanks to these virtual labs, our students have gained valuable hands-on experience that has positively impacted their understanding and skills in physics and electronics. We are proud to be at the forefront of technological innovation in education and will continue to strive towards excellence in this regard.
